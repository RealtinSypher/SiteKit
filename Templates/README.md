# SiteKit Templates

## Developing Custom Templates

To create your custom templates, start with the default structure as a guide.

**Folder Structure:**
```bash
myTemplate/
├─ Layout/   # Contains MainLayout.html.
├─ Pages/    # Holds your Markdown or HTML content.
├─ wwwroot/  # Includes CSS, images, JavaScript, etc.
```

Once your custom template folder is set up, compress it into a `.zip` file (e.g., myTemplate.zip), ensuring that the folder contents are at the root of the archive following the above structure.

Finally, copy the `.zip` file to the `UserDirectory/.SiteKit/templates` directory.
